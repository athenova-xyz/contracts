# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities affecting this project. Security is important to us — we take all reports seriously and will work with you to resolve any issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us by emailing security@athenova.xyz with the subject line:

"[Security] Vulnerability report — <short description>"

Include the following information where possible:
- Affected component(s) (contract name and path, e.g. `contracts/Crowdfund.sol`)
- Steps to reproduce the issue (minimal test case or transaction sequence)
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Severity assessment and potential impact
- Suggested mitigation or patch (if available)
- Any relevant logs, stack traces or transaction hashes

If email is not available, you may open a GitHub issue labelled `security` but please avoid posting sensitive details publicly. If possible, mark the issue as private or request disclosure coordination.

## Our Response Process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- We will assess the report and provide an initial response with estimated timelines within 10 business days.
- We will work with you to validate and remediate the issue. For critical vulnerabilities we may prioritize a faster response.
- We will coordinate public disclosure with the reporter. We ask that reporters do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we have a chance to address them.

## Scope

This policy covers vulnerabilities in code maintained within this repository (smart contracts, scripts, tests, and deployment artifacts). It does not cover third-party services, wallets, or integrations unless explicitly maintained here.

## Safe Harbor

We will treat good-faith security research as legitimate and will not initiate legal action against researchers who follow this policy.

## Credit

We welcome acknowledgement and credit for responsible disclosures. If you would like credit, please indicate how you would like to be credited in your report.

## Follow-up

If you do not receive an acknowledgement within 3 business days, or if you need to escalate, please contact security@athenova.xyz or open an urgent issue on GitHub.
